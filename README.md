# Car vs Bike Image Classification

This project involves building a binary image classification model to distinguish between cars and bikes using a custom dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images of vehicles as either cars or bikes. The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle, and the classification model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras.

Key features:
- **CNN Model**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras to perform binary image classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is processed using OpenCV for resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Visualization**: Results are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
